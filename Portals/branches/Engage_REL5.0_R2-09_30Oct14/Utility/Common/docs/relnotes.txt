When releasing, check the commits and increase version numbering X.Y.Z as follows: 
X is increased when most of the code is rewritten, or a major release on Production. 
Y is increased when new features are installed. 
Z is increased when only bugs are fixed.

Example A: Trunk 1.0.0 receive bug-fixes and becomes 1.0.1
Example B: Trunk 1.8.21 is needed for a long time so trunk becomes 2.0.0 and a branch from 1.8.21 is made (called utility-2.0) and future changes needed on site can be made on the branc with releases called 2.0.0a1 (with alpha numbers, releases on branches are expected to be stable all of them) with numbers above the last one on trunk, e.g. 2.0.0a1, 2.0.0a2, 2.0.0a3 and so on. These changes shall eb merged to trunk whenever needed.

When adding to the release notes, append newer entries above older entries.
